Title: A Basic Hardware Store
Description: Rewritten on 11/30/05. In this rewrite, the GUI is virtually the same, but the underlying code has had a major rewrite. In the previous version, there was one table. In this version, we have gone to multiple tables, where a table represents one tool. In addition, we show how to initialize the table during the initial call to the HardwareStore constructor.Updated 12/01/04 to loop on adds/updates/deletes. You can turn debug on/off from the menu bar. Send me an email if you have any problems with this example at ronholland@sumtotalz.com. This application shows the use of 
1- RandomAccessFile processing
2- JMenu 
3- JTable
4- Event processing
5- etc.
This is written between the intermediate and advanced programmer levels. A tutorial and Src are included to show you how to build the example.
